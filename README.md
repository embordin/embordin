# EMBordinHomePage
EMBordin is a small business consultancy on biotechnology focusing on ethanol corn base production. The home office is located in the city of Curitiba Southen, Brazil.
The website is actually an institutional webpage that shows the field of services offered to potential customers, introduces the principal scientist/consultant and the way to contact the company to ask questions regarding the services, tech issues and or quotations for services.
Briefly, EMBordin works with training to ethanol plant crew members, data analysis for plant optimization and on-site tech services.

The webpage was built on HTML, CSS and script from BoostStrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/). For that, the VSCode was the IDE for code development. The site was deployed in the test phase on Railway App (https://railway.app/project/bb5b9f6b-bdce-44f6-881e-f96de787d0a1) - https://embordin.up.railway.app/
